 <p>welcome to my web page again. <br>
 <p>My name is Hailu (in short version). I live in Seattle and currently i am going to Seattle Central College to study website development.</p><br>
 <p>I started to study IT three years ago. By then, i took a one year desktop support specialist program. I was so confortable with that program. After graduation, i provided volunteering service at Seattle YWCA as a Desktop support specialist for six months. <br>
<p>The experience i have got from that exposure let me rethink to decide to go back to school to advance my study, and that is why i am here studying website development. My objective is to be a front-end web developer.</p><br>
 <p>This is Spring 2018 quarter, and i am taking Web120 and PHP courses.!</p><br>

    <p><b>MOTIVATION</b><br>is what gets you started.<br><b>HABIT</b><br>is what keeps you going.<br><i>JIM ROHN!</i></p> <br><br>
